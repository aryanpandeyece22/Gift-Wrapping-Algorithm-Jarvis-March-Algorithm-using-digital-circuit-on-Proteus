# Gift-Wrapping-Algorithm-Jarvis-March-Algorithm-using-digital-circuit-on-Proteus
TASK :
Objective: Design a circuit using the Gift Wrapping Algorithm (Jarvis
March Algorithm) to compute the convex hull of a given set of n points
in x-y planes.
Compatibility: Ensure the circuit is compatible even if there are any
collinear points in the given set of points.
Constraints: 3<=n<=10. For each i from 1 to n: 0<= xi, yi <=7. No
constrain on using combinational or sequential approach for
implementing any segment of circuit. (n is the no. of points, (xi,yi) are
the coordinates of the ‘i’th point)
Output Specification: Show output as the sum of points on the convex
hull using seven-segment displays. For instance, if the convex hull of
points 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 3, 4, 5, then the output should be the sum of
these points, i.e., 12
I have two circuit to implement it. One have less components but huge complexity, other is less complex.
